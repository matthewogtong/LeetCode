# LeetCode Solutions in Swift

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, implemented in the Swift programming language.
I am using [Leethub](https://github.com/meolu/walle) as a tool to integrate my LeetCode solutions into this repository and adding my own solution details to each problem.

Each problem is stored in its own file, with the filename corresponding to the problem number and a brief description of the problem. For example, the solution to problem #14, "Longest Common Prefix," is stored in the file `0014-longest-common-prefix.swift`.

In each file, you'll find a Swift implementation of the solution, along with comments and step-by-step explanations of how the solution works. Some solutions may include multiple implementations with varying time and space complexities.

Feel free to use these solutions as a reference or starting point for your own LeetCode solutions in Swift. 
Also, please keep in mind that the solutions provided here are not necessarily the most optimal or efficient solutions, and there may be alternative approaches that are better suited to certain problem constraints.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to thank the following resources for helping me improve my skills in Swift and algorithmic problem solving:
